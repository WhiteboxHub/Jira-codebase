# Step 7: Managing Epics and Stories

## 1. Track Epic Progress:
- Track the overall progress of your Epic by viewing how many stories are completed.
- Use the **Epic Burndown Chart** (available in Scrum) to visualize the completion rate of stories over time.

## 2. Close Epic:
- Once all user stories under the Epic are marked as **“Done”**, close the Epic by updating its status to **“Done”**.
