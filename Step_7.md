#  Review and Adjust

## 1. Review Sprint/Backlog Regularly:
- Regularly assess the status of the sprint and backlog.
- Reprioritize stories as needed, or add new stories as your project progresses.

## 2. Hold Retrospectives:
- If using Scrum, hold sprint retrospectives at the end of each sprint to reflect on what went well, what could be improved, and adjust the process accordingly.
