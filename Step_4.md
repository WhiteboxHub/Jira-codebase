# Step 4: Prioritize Stories and Plan Sprint (if using Scrum)

## 1. Prioritize the Backlog:
- In the **Backlog** section, drag and drop the user stories to reorder them according to priority (High, Medium, Low).
- **High-priority** stories should be at the top of the list.

## 2. Start Sprint (if using Scrum):
- If using Scrum, select the stories you wish to work on in the upcoming sprint.
- Click **Start Sprint**, define the sprint duration (e.g., 2 weeks), and start working on the stories.
- **Sprint Goal**: Set a goal for the sprint (e.g., “Complete registration and contact us page”).

## 3. Assign Stories to Sprint:
- Select the stories to include in the sprint and ensure they are moved into the active sprint backlog.
