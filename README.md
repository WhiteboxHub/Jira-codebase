# Jira Docker Setup with PostgreSQL

  ## Steps:

1. **Prepare Files:**
   - **Dockerfile**: Configures Jira to connect to PostgreSQL.
   - **docker-compose.yml**: Defines Jira and PostgreSQL services.

2. **Run Containers:**
   - Use `docker-compose up -d` to start both services.

3. **Complete Setup:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:8080` to finish the Jira setup and connect to PostgreSQL.

4. **Create Admin Account:**
   - Create an admin account during the setup.

---
## 1. Create Project
Set up the **Whitebox Learning (WBL)** Scrum project in Jira to manage tasks and track progress.

---

## 2. Define Epics
Break down the entire system into large, high-level **epics**, such as:
- Home Page
- Schedule Management
- Resources (Recordings, Presentations, Resume Builder)
- FAQ Page
- Contact Page
- User Authentication

---

## 3. Add Stories and Tasks
For each epic, write detailed **user stories** representing the specific features or functionality. Break these stories into actionable **tasks** to ensure clarity and manageability.

---

## 4. Assign Subtasks
Create detailed **subtasks** for each task and assign them to team members. Subtasks should focus on individual, actionable components of the larger task.

---

## 5. Plan and Execute Sprints
Organize the **backlog** into **2-week sprints**:
- Assign tasks and stories to each sprint.
- Set sprint goals based on project priorities and deadlines.

---

## 6. Track Progress
Utilize Jira tools to monitor the progress of the project:
- Use **Scrum boards** to visualize the status of tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Generate **reports** like Burndown Charts and Velocity Charts to track sprint performance.

---

## 7. Review and Retrospect
At the end of each sprint:
- Analyze completed work and identify any blockers or areas for improvement.
- Hold a **sprint retrospective** to discuss what went well and what can be improved for the next sprint.
