# Step 5: Daily Standups Guide

## Purpose of Standups
Daily standups are short meetings conducted to ensure team alignment and identify blockers. Each team member provides a quick update answering the following three questions:

1. **What did you do yesterday?**  
2. **What will you do today?**  
3. **Are there any blockers?**

## Example Standup Updates

### Developer A  
- **Yesterday**: Worked on the homepage UI.  
- **Today**: Integrate backend APIs.  
- **Blockers**: Blocked by a missing endpoint from the backend team.  

### Tester B  
- **Yesterday**: Tested the FAQ page.  
- **Today**: Test the scheduler feature.  
- **Blockers**: No blockers currently.

## Best Practices
- Keep updates concise and relevant.  
- Raise blockers early so they can be addressed promptly.  
- Use Jira to update task statuses (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").  


# Track Progress Using Jira Boards

## 1. Track on Scrum/Kanban Board:
- Use the **Scrum board** if you’re working with sprints or the **Kanban board** if you’re using a flow-based method to track the progress of user stories.
- As you move stories from **“To Do”** to **“In Progress”** and then to **“Done”**, Jira will update the board accordingly.

## 2. Update Issues:
- Team members should update their issues by changing the status to reflect the current progress (e.g., “In Progress”, “In Review”, “Done”).
- Add comments or attachments if necessary to communicate progress.
