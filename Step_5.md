# Step 5: Track Progress Using Jira Boards

## 1. Track on Scrum/Kanban Board:
- Use the **Scrum board** if you’re working with sprints or the **Kanban board** if you’re using a flow-based method to track the progress of user stories.
- As you move stories from **“To Do”** to **“In Progress”** and then to **“Done”**, Jira will update the board accordingly.

## 2. Update Issues:
- Team members should update their issues by changing the status to reflect the current progress (e.g., “In Progress”, “In Review”, “Done”).
- Add comments or attachments if necessary to communicate progress.
