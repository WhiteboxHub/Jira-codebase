# Step 2: Create an Epic

An Epic is a large feature or set of tasks that can be broken down into smaller user stories. In this step, we’ll create the Epic for the Whitebox Learning project.

## 1. Navigate to Your Project:
- On your Jira dashboard, go to **Projects**, select “whitebox-learning”.

## 2. Create an Epic:
- Go to the **Backlog** section under the project.
- On the left-hand side, click on the **“Create Epic”** link.
- Alternatively, click **“Create Issue”**, then choose **Epic** from the dropdown.

## 3. Fill in the Epic Details:
- **Epic Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the Epic, such as “Whitebox Learning Website Development”.
- **Epic Summary**: Provide a brief overview of the Epic’s goal. For example, “Develop a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) for the website with features like a contact us page, user registration, scheduling, and more.”
- **Priority**: Set the priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- **Due Date**: Set a due date for the Epic if applicable.
- **Assign the Epic**: Assign the Epic to the relevant person or team.

## 4. Create the Epic:
