# Step 6: Types of Stories

Understanding different types of stories can help you manage your project better.

## 1. Functional Stories:
- Focus on user-facing features (e.g., “As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my dashboard”).

## 2. Non-Functional Stories:
- These deal with system performance or technical aspects (e.g., “As a user, I want the website to load in under 3 seconds”).

## 3. Technical Stories:
- Focus on backend work, system architecture, or technical setup (e.g., “Set up the database schema for user accounts”).

## 4. Defect Stories:
- Bugs that need to be fixed (e.g., “Fix the issue where the login button doesn’t work”).

## 5. Spike Stories:
- Tasks to research or experiment with technologies or solutions (e.g., “Investigate third-party plugins for contact form integration”).
