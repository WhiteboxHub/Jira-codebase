# Step 3: Create User Stories Under the Epic

User stories represent smaller, detailed pieces of work within an Epic. Here’s how to create stories under the Epic.

## 1. Create User Stories for Features:
- Go back to the **Backlog** section in your project.
- Click on **Create Issue**, and from the dropdown, select **Story**.

### Example Stories for the “whitebox-learning” project:
- “Create Home Page”
- “Develop Login Page”
- “Set up Registration Form”
- “Create Schedule Management”
- “Recording and User Media Page”

## 2. Link Stories to the Epic:
- After creating each story, link them to the Epic by selecting the **Epic Link** field and choosing the relevant Epic (e.g., “Whitebox Learning Development”).

## 3. Add Detailed Descriptions to Each Story:
- For each story, provide detailed descriptions outlining the work involved.

### Example for the “Create Home Page” story:
- “”

## 4. Assign Stories and Set Due Dates:
- Assign the stories to the relevant team members for implementation.
- Set due dates based on your project timeline or sprint schedule.
