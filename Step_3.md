# Step 3: Create User Stories Under the Epic

User stories represent smaller, detailed pieces of work within an Epic. Here’s how to create stories under the Epic.

## 1. Create User Stories for Features:
- Go back to the **Backlog** section in your project.
- Click on **Create Issue**, and from the dropdown, select **Story**.
- **Story Title**: Enter a descriptive, user-friendly title for the story.

### Example Stories for the “whitebox-learning” project:
- “Create Contact Us Page”
- “Develop Login Page”
- “Set up Registration Form”
- “Create Scheduling System”
- “Build Home Page”
- “Recording and User Media Page”

## 2. Link Stories to the Epic:
- After creating each story, link them to the Epic by selecting the **Epic Link** field and choosing the relevant Epic (e.g., “Whitebox Learning Website Development”).

## 3. Add Detailed Descriptions to Each Story:
- For each story, provide detailed descriptions outlining the work involved.

### Example for the “Create Contact Us Page” story:
- “Design and implement a contact form that includes name, email, and message fields. The form should submit data to the designated email address (support@whitebox.com).”

## 4. Assign Stories and Set Due Dates:
- Assign the stories to the relevant team members for implementation.
- Set due dates based on your project timeline or sprint schedule.
