# Step 1: Create a Jira Project

Creating a Jira project is the first step to organize your work.

## 1. Log in to Jira:
- Open your browser and log in to your Jira instance using your credentials.
- Once logged in, you’ll land on the Jira dashboard, where you can access your existing projects.

## 2. Navigate to the Project Creation Page:
- In the navigation bar, click on the “Projects” menu, and select “Create Project”.
- If prompted on the homepage, you might see a direct “Create Project” button; click on it.

## 3. Select a Project Template:
Jira offers several project templates, including Scrum, Kanban, Bug Tracking, and more.

- **Scrum**: Best for Agile teams working in sprints and iterations.
- **Kanban**: Ideal for teams who prefer continuous delivery and a flow-based approach.
- **Bug Tracking**: A more specialized template used for managing software bugs and issues.

### Recommendation for Whitebox Learning:
Use the Scrum template if you want to use time-boxed iterations, or Kanban if your workflow is more continuous.

## 4. Set the Project Name and Key:
- **Project Name**: Enter “whitebox-learning” as the project name.
- **Project Key**: This is an abbreviation of your project used for issue identifiers (e.g., WB for Whitebox Learning). It is auto-generated, but you can change it if desired.
    - Example: `WB` (Whitebox Learning).

## 5. Choose Project Lead and Permissions:
- **Project Lead**: This person will be responsible for overseeing the project. You can select someone from your team or yourself.
- **Permissions**: Set user permissions based on who needs access to the project (viewers, developers, admins, etc.). You can choose default permissions or create custom ones to match your team’s structure.

## 6. Create the Project:
- After configuring the project settings, click **Create** to initialize the project.
- You’ll be redirected to the project dashboard to start adding tasks, epics, and user stories.

## Types of Issues and Their Usage

- **Epic**: Represents large features or components.
- **Story**: A user-facing feature or task that delivers value.
- **Task**: A smaller, specific action or requirement within a story.
- **Bug**: An issue or defect that needs to be fixed.
- **Sub-task**: A smaller unit of work that’s part of a larger issue (e.g., a specific task within a story).
